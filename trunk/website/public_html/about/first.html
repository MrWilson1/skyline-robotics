						<blockquote>
							FIRST was founded in 1989 by inventor Dean Kamen, who tirelessly pursued 
							his dream of "creating a world where science and technology are celebrated 
							and where young people dream of becoming science and technology leaders." 
							He was determined to inspire the youth, bridging any uncertainties, to 
							lead us, the leaders of tomorrow's world, to set off a chain reaction 
							of young leaders. He promoted the importance of science and technology to 
							the world and dared us to do better. FIRST inspires young generations to 
							participate in Dean Kamen's dream. Created in Manchester, NH, FIRST has 
							now become a world-wide advocate for science, technology, and math, while 
							spawning new leaders.

							<p>
								FIRST, although victory is important, one must win for the sake of 
								competition, not for the sake of feeling good.  FIRST's goal is to
								simply raise awareness through competition so that the passion exerted
								in competition will reflect in leadership a FIRST member that will take the
								steps to inspire and innovate.  The foundation of FIRST is to motivate the
								yourth to greatness.
