						<h3 id="typical_schedule">Our Typical Schedule</h3>
						<p>
							Our season officially starts in September, when school
							starts.  We give some demonstrations of robotics,
							elect our officers, and get everybody oriented.
							For the first two or three months, we focus on training
							our new members and preparing for the competition.  If
							we have time, and if our budget allows it, we might
							participate in smaller competitions, such as FTC (FIRST
							Tech Challenge) as practice.  
						</p>
						<p>
							In addition to training, we also work on the more social
							aspect of Robotics Club.  We spend time some time
							fundraising -- despite our 
							<a href="/thanks/sponsors.html">sponsors</a>, we are in
							perpetual need of money to buy supplies, parts, and
							tools. We also prepare for the main FRC competition in
							Spring by planning designs for t-shirts and pin-on buttons --
							it's a tradition at FIRST to bring badges and buttons and 
							trade them with other teams.
						</p>
						<p>
							In about December or January, the competition formally
							starts.  We attend the kickoff, where we learn the exact
							details of the competition, then start brainstorming
							nearly right away.  The goal of the competition is
							completely different each year, and is almost impossible
							to predict in advance.
						</p>
						<p>
							For the next two or three months, we meet around three 
							times a week, for several hours each, to build and test 
							our robot.  
							After about two or three
							months, all teams stop work on the robot, bag them, and
							wait for the competition to start.
						</p>
						<p>
							In spring, we get to attend the long-awaited competition!
							Even in just the regional competitions, the energy is 
							unbelievable, and the sheer diversity of the robots and 
							teams is incredible.  Typically, the competition lasts
							about 3 days (not counting the time allocated to setting
							up and debugging the robot the day before).
						</p>
						<p>
							In addition to awards for winning the competition, there
							are also additional awards for best design, best safety,
							and best website, among others.
						</p>
						<p>	
							The end of the year is dedicated towards debriefing,
							and potentially demonstrating our robot to others as
							a part of our <a href="/about/outreach.html">outreach</a>
							efforts.
