							<h2>Our Appreciation</h2>
						</div>
						<p>
							We at Spartabots are tremendously thankful for the support and
							help of our sponsors, mentors, parents, and other volunteers.
							Without them, we can honestly say that our Robotics club would
							never be able to function.
						</p>
						
						<p>
							By either donating tools, money, time, or their knowledge, our
							sponsors, mentors, and volunteers made it possible for our 
							robotics club to both function and grow.
						</p>
						
						<p>
							To show our appreciation for them, we've decided to create an
							entire section of our website devoted to thanking them.
						</p>
						
						<h3><a href="/thanks/sponsors.html">Our Sponsors</a></h3>
						<p>
							Without the money that our sponsors provide, we wouldn't be able
							to purchase parts for our robots, or attend competitions.  
							<a href="/thanks/sponsors.html">Learn more about our sponsors</a>.
						</p>
						
						<h3><a href="/thanks/mentors.html">Our Mentors</a></h3>
						<p>
							Our mentors provide valuable help and advice to our team.  We're
							extremely grateful how they spend so much time helping and
							teaching members of our team.
							<a href="/thanks/mentors.html">Learn more about our mentors</a>.
						</p>
						
						<h3><a href="/thnaks/volunteers.html">Our Parents and other Volunteers</h3>
						<p>
							From buying dinner, to driving members of our team around, we're
							grateful for all of their assistance to the team.
							<a href="/thanks/volunteers.html">Learn more about our parents and
							other volunteers here.</a>
						</p>
						
						<h3>What you can do</h3>
						<p>
							You can donate money, or become a mentor.
							TODO:  Make this more polite.
