    <h4><a href="FIRSTVISION.html"> FIRST Vision and Mission</a></h4><p>"To transform our culture by creating a world where science and technology are celebrated and where young people dream of becoming science and technology leaders."

Dean Kamen, Founder</p>

<p>FIRST's mission is to inspire young people to be science and technology leaders, 
by engaging them in exciting mentor-based programs that build science, engineering
 and technology skills, that inspire innovation, and that foster well-rounded life 
 capabilities including self-confidence, communication, and leadership.</p><hr />
 <h4><a href="GraciousProfes.html"> Gracious Professionalism</a></h4><p>“Gracious Professionalism” was a term created by
   Dr. Woodie Flowers, the FIRST National Advisor and Pappalardo Professor Emeritus of 
   Mechanical Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Technology. This term not only has 
   a glorious position in FIRST, it is practiced in every FIRST competition to encourage 
   high-quality work, emphasize the value of others, and respect individuals and the community.
   Gracious Professionalism teaches students to compete fiercely, but for the benefit of society, 
   not with pure victory in mind. Yes, winning is a great deal of excitement, within FIRST, but
   these winners neither boast nor express any dominance, but they lend a helping hand to guide
   other players and teams to share their glory. Gracious Professionalism is the root for respect in the FIRST society.

<h2>FIRST History</h2><p>FIRST was founded in 1989 by inventor DeanKamen,
  who tirelessly pursued his dream of "creating a world where science and
  technology are celebrated and where young people dream of becoming science
  and technology leaders." He was determined to inspire the youth,
  bridging any uncertainties, to lead us, the leaders of tomorrow's
  world, to set off a chain reaction of young leaders. He promoted the
  importance of science and technology to the world and dared us to do better.
  FIRST inspires young generations to participate in Dean Kamen's
  dream. Created in Manchester, NH, FIRST has now become a world-wide advocate
  for science, technology, and math, while spawning new leaders.</p><p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p><hr />
