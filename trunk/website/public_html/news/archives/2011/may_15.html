							<h2>Meeting Summary</h2>
							<p class="date">2011 May 11</p>
						</div>
						<p>
							Hi everyone, in case you missed today's meeting, here is a
							quick overview of the topics we discussed.
						</p>
						
						<h3>End of Year Party:</h3>
						<p>
							As previously mentioned, May 21st will not work as people
							have various other commitments (i.e. Relay for Life) on that
							day.  The only other date available at Pine Lake Park before
							the school year ends which is on a Saturday is May 28th.
							Please reply to this email if you have a problem with this
							date.  As May 28th is on Memorial Day Weekend, people may be
							going out of town and we need to know how many people can 
							actually attend.  Also, include your opinion about a party on
							a Sunday or a suggestion for a certain weekday.
						</p>
						<p>
							The sign up sheet for food is still going around so please
							email Sampurna at 
							<a href="mailto:pifor23@gmail.com">pifor23@gmail.com</a>
							with any contributions you are willing to make.
						</p>
						
						<h3>The Robot:</h3>
						<p>
							Our Robotics equipment has made it to Skyline!  A big thanks
							to Dom who picked it up from Mr. Cooper's house.
						</p>
						<p>
							Next week, we will start to revive the robot in order to get
							it ready for future demonstrations.
						</p>
						
						<h3>Website:</h3>
						<p>
							Website Team: Keep a look-out for announcement emails from
							Michael.
						</p>
						
						<h3>Farmer's Market:</h3>
						<p>
							Our Farmer's Market booth will be on Wednesday, June 29th.
							Michael and Lalith are currently the full-time volunteers
							at our booth; if you would like to help out, please email Amy.
						</p>
						<p>
							We need informational fliers and a poster for our booth.  If
							someone would like to start working on content and design, 
							please feel free to do so and bring your ideas to the next
							meeting.
						</p>
						
						<h3>Mentoring:</h3>
						<p>
							Mr. Kumaressen's colleague is available Mondays, Wednesdays,
							and weekends after 5 PM (this is including the summer).
							Further information for those interested in honing their
							programming skills will be available at the next meeting.
						</p>
						
						<h3>Posters for Next Year:</h3>
						<p>
							In order to streamline the ASB approval process for next year,
							we have decided to start working on poster designs now.  If you
							have ideas, please feel free to start working on them and bring
							them to the next meeting.
						</p>
						
						<p>
							Hope to see you all at the next meeting! (Thursday May 19th).
