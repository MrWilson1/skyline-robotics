							Hi everyone, in case you missed today's meeting, here is a
							quick overview of the topics we discussed.
						</p>
						
						<h3>End of Year Party:</h3>
						<p>
							As previously mentioned, May 21st will not work as people
							have various other commitments (i.e. Relay for Life) on that
							day.  The only other date available at Pine Lake Park before
							the school year ends which is on a Saturday is May 28th.
							Please reply to this email if you have a problem with this
							date.  As May 28th is on Memorial Day Weekend, people may be
							going out of town and we need to know how many people can 
							actually attend.  Also, include your opinion about a party on
							a Sunday or a suggestion for a certain weekday.
						</p>
