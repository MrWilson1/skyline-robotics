							<h2>About this website</h2>

						<h3 id="general_information">General Information</h3>
						<p>
							This website was completely handwritten.  The theme and
							structure of this website is completely original, and was
							written by members of our team.
						</p>
						
						<h3 id="valid_html_and_css">Valid HTML and CSS</h3>
						<p>
							This website is written in 
							<a href="http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=referer">
							valid HTML 4.01 Transitional
							</a>
							and in
							<a href="http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/check/referer?profile=css3&amp;vextwarning=true">
							valid CSS 3.
							</a>
							This means that special care was taken to ensure that the HTML
							and the CSS for this website is syntactically correct and
							semantically logical, ensuring that it is rendered correctly by
							all browsers.
						</p>
						<p>
							We chose to use a HTML 4.01 Transitional because so that we can
							use elements such as iFrames, allowing us to embed external documents
							and applets in our website with ease.
						</p>
						<p>
							We chose to use CSS 3 instead of CSS 2 because of the many innovative
							features it offers, such as transparency and rounded corners.
							Unfortunately, due to the relative newness of CSS 3, it isn't
							fully supported by all browsers yet.  For that reason, we used
							a few proprietary tags to allow the use of transparency and rounded
							corners, especially in older browsers.  We hope to eventually phase
							out these stopgap measures as users start migrating to newer and
							more capable browsers.
						
						<h3 id="browser_compatibility">Browser Compatibility</h3>
						<p>
							Despite using many newer features in CSS, we value usability and compatibility
							among all browsers.  For that reason, our website has been calibrated to
							support IE6+, Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Opera.  Our webpage is 
							designed to degrade gracefully so that older browsers are still
							capable of viewing this website.
